## Overview :eyes:
This project aims to convert the value desired by the user in dollars, pounds sterling or euros into reais.
It was developed during a module on Rocketseat's "Fullstack" track, in class, together with the teacher, with the aim of learning in practice how to program with JavaScript. After completing it, I reviewed every detail of the code, delving deeper into each concept worked on.

## Features :tophat:
- Responsive layout
- Fast and practical conversion
